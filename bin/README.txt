=====STORMNADO=====

London is under attack by rain clouds, and only you can stop them!
Type the words on the clouds, and hold out as long as possible before
the whole of London is flushed away.

=====CONTROLS=====

Just type the words to get rid of the clouds! [Enter] & [Delete] will
reset the current word, and [Backspace] will remove the last letter.
Just like Word, you know?

word generating function ("triterpene", hell yeah!).
- @DerColorMan, for giving me a nice and variated list of words for the
game to use.
- GameArtForge, for his awesome clouds (which I pixelized by the way, to
suit the style of the game). Find it here:

=====ABOUT=====

This game was made by Bob Rubbens (http://www.plusminos.nl, @broervanlisa,
bobrubbens _at_ gmail.com) for The Arbitrary Gamejam #13
(http://www.ticktakashi.com/, http://hilgames.com/tagjam13/). It took two
short days and a lot of coffee to make it. It was made with the C graphics
library SDL2, the C++ programming language, the gVim editor, the GIMP
(Photoshop sucks! Booooo.), the Tup build system, and Bob's own WIP C++ game
library, Nuts 'n Bolts. If you have any comments, critics or questions, feel
free to give me a shout! And if you're interested in the source (really?) you
can probably find it on github one of these days. My github handle is 
bobismijnnaam, and if I forget about it don't hesitate to remind me.
